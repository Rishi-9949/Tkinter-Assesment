# Tkinter-Assesment

This assessment activity requires you to plan, trial, test and develop a computer program using advanced programming techniques. You will utilise a development process to help you make informed decisions throughout the coding, testing and trialling of your program and show ongoing refinement to improve the functionality and quality of your program.

You will be assessed on how effectively you plan your development, decompose the outcome into smaller components, and test and refine your program so that it is a high-quality response to the task (e.g. well-structured, logical, flexible, robust and comprehensively tested).

When planning and developing your program, you must ensure your program:

uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
takes input from a user, sensor(s), or other external source(s)
produces output
AND includes two or more advanced programming techniques, such as writing code that:

modifies data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries)
defines and manipulates multidimensional data in collections
creates methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters and/or return values
responds to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)
requires non-basic string manipulation
uses functionality of additional non-core libraries.


Julie runs a party hire store and has a range of items for hire. She needs to keep a track of items that are currently out

She needs to keep the following details

Customer full name
Receipt number
The item that is hired
How many of the item the customer has hired
To ensure good data collection the following are required
Customer full name required
Receipt number number only
The item that is hired required
How many of the item the customer has hired between 1 and 500
When an item is returned she needs to be able to delete it, so it no longer shows.
